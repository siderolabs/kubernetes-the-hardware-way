# Cleaning Up

In this lab you will delete the compute resources created during this tutorial.

## Compute Instances

Press the power button on each computer and they will turn off.
No money will be spent because you already own the machines.

If you really want to make sure no power is consumed you can unplug the computers from power.

If you want to use the cluster again you can turn on the computers.
